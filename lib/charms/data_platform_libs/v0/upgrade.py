r"""Library to manage in-place upgrades for charms running on VMs and K8s.

This library contains handlers for `upgrade` relation events used to coordinate
between units in an application during a `juju refresh`, as well as `Pydantic` models
for instantiating, validating and comparing dependencies.

An upgrade on VMs is initiated with the command `juju refresh`. Once executed, the following
events are emitted to each unit at random:
    - `upgrade-charm`
    - `config-changed`
    - `leader-settings-changed` - Non-leader only

Charm authors can implement the classes defined in this library to streamline the process of
coordinating which unit updates when, achieved through updating of unit-data `state` throughout.

At a high-level, the upgrade steps are as follows:
    - Run pre-checks on the cluster to confirm it is safe to upgrade
    - Create stack of unit.ids, to serve as the upgrade order (generally workload leader is last)
    - Start the upgrade by issuing a Juju CLI command
    - The unit at the top of the stack gets permission to upgrade
    - The unit handles the upgrade and restarts their service
    - Repeat, until all units have restarted

### Usage by charm authors

#### `upgrade` relation

Charm authors must implement an additional peer-relation.

As this library uses relation data exchanged between units to coordinate, charm authors
need to add a new relation interface. The relation name does not matter.

`metadata.yaml`
```yaml
peers:
  upgrade:
    interface: upgrade
```

#### Dependencies JSON/Dict

Charm authors must implement a dict object tracking current charm versions, requirements + upgradability.

Many workload versions may be incompatible with older/newer versions. This same idea also can apply to
charm or snap versions. Workloads with required related applications (e.g Kafka + ZooKeeper) also need to
ensure their versions are compatible during an upgrade, to avoid cluster failure.

As such, it is necessasry to freeze any dependencies within each published charm. An example of this could
be creating a `DEPENDENCIES` dict within the charm code, with the following structure:

`src/literals.py`
```python
DEPENDENCIES = {
    "kafka_charm": {
        "dependencies": {"zookeeper": ">50"},
        "name": "kafka",
        "upgrade_supported": ">90",
        "version": "100",
    },
    "kafka_service": {
        "dependencies": {"zookeeper": "^3"},
        "name": "kafka",
        "upgrade_supported": ">=0.8",
        "version": "3.3.2",
    },
}
```

The first-level key names are arbitrary labels for tracking what those versions+dependencies are for.
The `dependencies` second-level values are a key-value map of any required external applications,
    and the versions this packaged charm can support.
The `upgrade_suppported` second-level values are requirements from which an in-place upgrade can be
    supported by the charm.
The `version` second-level values correspond to the current version of this packaged charm.

Any requirements comply with [`poetry`'s dependency specifications](https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification/#caret-requirements).

### Dependency Model

Charm authors must implement their own class inheriting from `DependencyModel`.

Using a `Pydantic` model to instantiate the aforementioned `DEPENDENCIES` dict gives stronger type safety and additional
layers of validation.

Implementation just needs to ensure that the top-level key names from `DEPENDENCIES` are defined as attributed in the model.

`src/upgrade.py`
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

class KafkaDependenciesModel(BaseModel):
    kafka_charm: DependencyModel
    kafka_service: DependencyModel
```

### Overrides for `DataUpgrade`

Charm authors must define their own class, inheriting from `DataUpgrade`, overriding all required `abstractmethod`s.

```python
class ZooKeeperUpgrade(DataUpgrade):
    def __init__(self, charm: "ZooKeeperUpgrade", **kwargs):
        super().__init__(charm, **kwargs)
        self.charm = charm
```

#### Implementation of `pre_upgrade_check()`

Before upgrading a cluster, it's a good idea to check that it is stable and healthy before permitting it.
Here, charm authors can validate upgrade safety through API calls, relation-data checks, etc.
If any of these checks fail, raise `ClusterNotReadyError`.

```python
    @override
    def pre_upgrade_check(self) -> None:
        default_message = "Pre-upgrade check failed and cannot safely upgrade"
        try:
            if not self.client.members_broadcasting or not len(self.client.server_members) == len(
                self.charm.cluster.peer_units
            ):
                raise ClusterNotReadyError(
                    message=default_message,
                    cause="Not all application units are connected and broadcasting in the quorum",
                )

            if self.client.members_syncing:
                raise ClusterNotReadyError(
                    message=default_message, cause="Some quorum members are syncing data"
                )

            if not self.charm.cluster.stable:
                raise ClusterNotReadyError(
                    message=default_message, cause="Charm has not finished initialising"
                )

        except QuorumLeaderNotFoundError:
            raise ClusterNotReadyError(message=default_message, cause="Quorum leader not found")
        except ConnectionClosedError:
            raise ClusterNotReadyError(
                message=default_message, cause="Unable to connect to the cluster"
            )
```

#### Implementation of `build_upgrade_stack()` - VM ONLY

Oftentimes, it is necessary to ensure that the workload leader is the last unit to upgrade,
to ensure high-availability during the upgrade process.
Here, charm authors can create a LIFO stack of unit.ids, represented as a list of unit.id strings,
with the leader unit being at i[0].

```python
@override
def build_upgrade_stack(self) -> list[int]:
    upgrade_stack = []
    for unit in self.charm.cluster.peer_units:
        config = self.charm.cluster.unit_config(unit=unit)

        # upgrade quorum leader last
        if config["host"] == self.client.leader:
            upgrade_stack.insert(0, int(config["unit_id"]))
        else:
            upgrade_stack.append(int(config["unit_id"]))

    return upgrade_stack
```

#### Implementation of `_on_upgrade_granted()`

On relation-changed events, each unit will check the current upgrade-stack persisted to relation data.
If that unit is at the top of the stack, it will emit an `upgrade-granted` event, which must be handled.
Here, workloads can be re-installed with new versions, checks can be made, data synced etc.
If the new unit successfully rejoined the cluster, call `set_unit_completed()`.
If the new unit failed to rejoin the cluster, call `set_unit_failed()`.

NOTE - It is essential here to manually call `on_upgrade_changed` if the unit is the current leader.
This ensures that the leader gets it's own relation-changed event, and updates the upgrade-stack for
other units to follow suit.

```python
@override
def _on_upgrade_granted(self, event: UpgradeGrantedEvent) -> None:
    self.charm.snap.stop_snap_service()

    if not self.charm.snap.install():
        logger.error("Unable to install ZooKeeper Snap")
        self.set_unit_failed()
        return None

    logger.info(f"{self.charm.unit.name} upgrading service...")
    self.charm.snap.restart_snap_service()

    try:
        logger.debug("Running post-upgrade check...")
        self.pre_upgrade_check()

        logger.debug("Marking unit completed...")
        self.set_unit_completed()

        # ensures leader gets it's own relation-changed when it upgrades
        if self.charm.unit.is_leader():
            logger.debug("Re-emitting upgrade-changed on leader...")
            self.on_upgrade_changed(event)

    except ClusterNotReadyError as e:
        logger.error(e.cause)
        self.set_unit_failed()
```

#### Implementation of `log_rollback_instructions()`

If the upgrade fails, manual intervention may be required for cluster recovery.
Here, charm authors can log out any necessary steps to take to recover from a failed upgrade.
When a unit fails, this library will automatically log out this message.

```python
@override
def log_rollback_instructions(self) -> None:
    logger.error("Upgrade failed. Please run `juju refresh` to previous version.")
```

### Instantiating in the charm and deferring events

Charm authors must add a class attribute for the child class of `DataUpgrade` in the main charm.
They must also ensure that any non-upgrade related events that may be unsafe to handle during
an upgrade, are deferred if the unit is not in the `idle` state - i.e not currently upgrading.

```python
class ZooKeeperCharm(CharmBase):
    def __init__(self, *args):
        super().__init__(*args)
        self.upgrade = ZooKeeperUpgrade(
            self,
            relation_name = "upgrade",
            substrate = "vm",
            dependency_model=ZooKeeperDependencyModel(
                **DEPENDENCIES
            ),
        )

    def restart(self, event) -> None:
        if not self.upgrade.state == "idle":
            event.defer()
            return None

        self.restart_snap_service()
```
