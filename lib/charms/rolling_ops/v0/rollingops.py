"""This library enables "rolling" operations across units of a charmed Application.

For example, a charm author might use this library to implement a "rolling restart", in
which all units in an application restart their workload, but no two units execute the
restart at the same time.

To implement the rolling restart, a charm author would do the following:

1. Add a peer relation called 'restart' to a charm's `metadata.yaml`:
```yaml
peers:
    restart:
        interface: rolling_op
```

Import this library into src/charm.py, and initialize a RollingOpsManager in the Charm's
`__init__`. The Charm should also define a callback routine, which will be executed when
a unit holds the distributed lock:

src/charm.py
```python
# ...
from charms.rolling_ops.v0.rollingops import RollingOpsManager
# ...
class SomeCharm(...):
    def __init__(...)
        # ...
        self.restart_manager = RollingOpsManager(
            charm=self, relation="restart", callback=self._restart
        )
        # ...
    def _restart(self, event):
        systemd.service_restart('foo')
```

To kick off the rolling restart, emit this library's AcquireLock event. The simplest way
to do so would be with an action, though it might make sense to acquire the lock in
response to another event. 

```python
    def _on_trigger_restart(self, event):
        self.charm.on[self.restart_manager.name].acquire_lock.emit()
```

In order to trigger the restart, a human operator would execute the following command on
the CLI:

```
juju run-action some-charm/0 some-charm/1 <... some-charm/n> restart
```

Note that all units that plan to restart must receive the action and emit the aquire
event. Any units that do not run their acquire handler will be left out of the rolling
restart. (An operator might take advantage of this fact to recover from a failed rolling
operation without restarting workloads that were able to successfully restart -- simply
omit the successful units from a subsequent run-action call.)

class Lock:
    """A class that keeps track of a single asynchronous lock.

    Warning: a Lock has permission to update relation data, which means that there are
    side effects to invoking the .acquire, .release and .grant methods. Running any one of
    them will trigger a RelationChanged event, once per transition from one internal
    status to another.

    This class tracks state across the cloud by implementing a peer relation
    interface. There are two parts to the interface:

    1) The data on a unit's peer relation (defined in metadata.yaml.) Each unit can update
       this data. The only meaningful values are "acquire", and "release", which represent
       a request to acquire the lock, and a request to release the lock, respectively.

    2) The application data in the relation. This tracks whether the lock has been
       "granted", Or has been released (and reverted to idle). There are two valid states:
       "granted" or None.  If a lock is in the "granted" state, a unit should emit a
       RunWithLocks event and then release the lock.

       If a lock is in "None", this means that a unit has not yet requested the lock, or
       that the request has been completed.

    In more detail, here is the relation structure:

    relation.data:
        <unit n>:
            status: 'acquire|release'
        <application>:
           <unit n>: 'granted|None'

    Note that this class makes no attempts to timestamp the locks and thus handle multiple
    requests in a row. If a unit re-requests a lock before being granted the lock, the
    lock will simply stay in the "acquire" state. If a unit wishes to clear its lock, it
    simply needs to call lock.release().
