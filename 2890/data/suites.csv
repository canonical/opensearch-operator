"Build and deploy a large deployment for OpenSearch.

    The following apps will be deployed:
    * main: the main orchestrator
    * failover: the failover orchestrator
    * opensearch (or APP_NAME): the data.hot node

    The data node is selected to adopt the ""APP_NAME"" value because it is the node which
    ContinuousWrites will later target its writes to.
