"Tests the removal of specific units (elected cm, juju leader, node with prim shard).

    The goal of this test is to make sure that:
     - the CM reelection happens successfully.
     - the leader-elected event gets triggered successfully and
        leadership related events on the charm work correctly, i.e: roles reassigning.
     - the primary shards reelection happens successfully.
    It is worth noting that we're going into this test with an odd number of units.

"Build and deploy a large deployment for OpenSearch.

    The following apps will be deployed:
    * main: the main orchestrator
    * failover: the failover orchestrator
    * opensearch (or APP_NAME): the data.hot node

    The data node is selected to adopt the ""APP_NAME"" value because it is the node which
    ContinuousWrites will later target its writes to.
