"Tests the entire cycle of KNN plugin.

    1) Enters data and trains a model in ""test_end_to_end_with_ivf_faiss_training""
    2) Trains model: ""test_end_to_end_with_ivf_faiss_model""
    3) Once training is complete, creates a target index and connects with the model
    4) Disables KNN plugin: the search must fail
    5) Re-enables the plugin: search must succeed and return two vectors.
