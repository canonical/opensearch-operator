# Charmed OpenSearch Documentation
The Charmed OpenSearch Operator delivers automated operations management from day 0 to day 2 on the [OpenSearch Community Edition](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/) document database. It is an open source, end-to-end, production-ready data platform product on top of juju.

OpenSearch is an open-source search and analytics suite that makes it easy to ingest, search, visualize, and analyze data. The OpenSearch project is a forked search project based on Elasticsearch and Kibana.

It offers features such as horizontal scaling, replication, TLS, password rotation, and easy to use integration with other applications.
