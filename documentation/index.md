## Charmed OpenSearch Documentation
The Charmed OpenSearch Operator delivers automated operations management from day 0 to day 2 on the [OpenSearch Community Edition](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/) document database. It is an open source, end-to-end, production-ready data platform product on top of juju.

OpenSearch is a popular NoSQL database. It stores data as JSON documents in searchable indices, which are queried using a REST API. OpenSearch is also a distributed database, so vertical and horizontal scaling come naturally.

This charmed operator deploys and operates OpenSearch on physical or virtual machines. It offers features such as horizontal scaling, replication, TLS, password rotation, and easy to use integration with other applications. The Charmed OpenSearch Operator meets the need of deploying OpenSearch in a structured and consistent manner while allowing the user flexibility in configuration. It simplifies deployment, scaling, configuration and management of OpenSearch in production at scale in a reliable way.
