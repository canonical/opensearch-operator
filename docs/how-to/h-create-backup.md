# How to create a backup

This guide contains recommended steps and useful commands for creating and managing backups to ensure smooth restores.

## Prerequisites
* A cluster with at least three nodes deployed
* Access to an S3-compatible storage
* Configured settings for the S3-compatible storage

## Summary
* [Save your current cluster credentials](#save-your-current-cluster-credentials), as youâ€™ll need them for restoring
* [Create a backup](#create-a-backup)
* [List backups](#list-backups) to check the availability and status of your backups

--- 
## Save your current cluster credentials

For security reasons, charm credentials are not stored inside backups. So, if you plan to restore to a backup at any point in the future, you will need the new user password as well as certificates/keys for your existing cluster.

You can retrieve the credentials of the admin user with the following command:

```none
juju run opensearch/leader get-password
Running operation 141 with 1 task
  - task 142 on unit-opensearch-0

Waiting for task 142...
ca-chain: |-
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
password: <pass>
username: admin
```

## Create a backup

Once you have a three-node cluster with configurations set for S3 storage, check that Charmed OpenSearch is active and idle with juju status.

Once Charmed OpenSearch is `active` and `idle`, you can create your first backup with the `create-backup` command:

```none
juju run opensearch/leader create-backup
Running operation 333 with 1 task
  - task 334 on unit-opensearch-0

Waiting for task 334...
backup-id: "2024-04-25T21:16:26Z"
status: Backup is running.
```

## List backups

You can list your available, failed, and in progress backups by running the `list-backups` command:

```
juju run opensearch/leader list-backups
Running operation 335 with 1 task
  - task 336 on unit-opensearch-0

Waiting for task 336...
backups: |2-
   backup-id           | backup-status
