## Integrations

Like all Juju charms, OpenSearch can easily integrate with other charms by implementing common interfaces/endpoints.

OpenSearch can be seamlessly integrated out of the box with:

* [TLS certificates charms](https://charmhub.io/topics/security-with-x-509-certificates#heading--understanding-your-x-509-certificates-requirements)
  * **Note**: Charmed OpenSearch supports integration with [tls-certificates library](https://charmhub.io/tls-certificates-interface/libraries/tls_certificates) `v2` or higher.
* [COS Lite](https://charmhub.io/cos-lite)
* [OpenSearch Dashboards](https://charmhub.io/opensearch-dashboards)
* [Data Integrator](https://charmhub.io/data-integrator)
* [S3 Integrator](https://charmhub.io/s3-integrator)

See the [Integrations page](https://charmhub.io/opensearch/integrations) for a list of all interfaces and compatible charms.

## Software contents

This charm is based on the Canonical [opensearch-snap](https://github.com/canonical/opensearch-snap). It packages:
* OpenSearch v2.17.0
* OpenJDK `v21`

## Known issues and limitations

The following issues are known and scheduled to be fixed in the next maintenance release.

* We currently do not support node role repurposing from cluster manager to a non cluster manager
* Storage re-attachment from previous clusters is not currently automated. For manual instructions, see the how-to guide [How to recover from attached storage](/t/15616).
