> [Charmed OpenSearch Tutorial](/t/9722) > 7. Clean up the environment

# Clean up the environment
In this tutorial, weâ€™ve successfully:

* Deployed OpenSearch on LXD
* Enabled TLS
* Integrated with a client application
* Rotated user credentials
* Scaled our deployment

You may now keep your OpenSearch deployment running to continue experimenting, or remove it entirely to free up resources on your machine.
