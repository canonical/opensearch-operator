# Charmed OpenSearch Documentation
The Charmed OpenSearch Operator delivers automated operations management from day 0 to day 2 on the [OpenSearch Community Edition](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/) document database. It is an open source, end-to-end, production-ready data platform product on top of juju.

OpenSearch is an open-source search and analytics suite that makes it easy to ingest, search, visualize, and analyze data. The OpenSearch project is a forked search project based on Elasticsearch and Kibana.

This charmed operator deploys and operates OpenSearch on physical or virtual machines. It offers features such as horizontal scaling, replication, TLS, password rotation, and easy to use integration with other applications. The Charmed OpenSearch Operator meets the need of deploying OpenSearch in a structured and consistent manner while allowing the user flexibility in configuration. It simplifies deployment, scaling, configuration and management of OpenSearch in production at scale in a reliable way.
